## ðŸ¤– How to run it

### Step 1: Open follower page

First off, we need to find all the people, organisations and hashtags you follow. Therefore login to LinkedIn and visit ["Manage Follows"](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/network-manager/people-follow/followers/) in a new tab.

### Step 2: Open browser console

Now we're going to open our browser console. In most common browsers we chose any element on the page and then right click âžœ "Inspect". Now the developer tools should be opened at the bottom or right side. Navigate to the console tab.

### Step 3: Paste script in console

For the last step, just copy the script into the browser console. Just select everything here [linkedminus.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaibrune/linkedminus/main/linkedminus.js) (open in a new tab) and hit enter. Done!

## ðŸ¤” FAQ

### What is if not all entries are unfollowed after one run-through?

If not all followers are unfollowed, reload the page and repeat the process until the following count reaches zero and LinkedIn displays "Follow Fresh Perspectives".
